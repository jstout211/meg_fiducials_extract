## MEG Research Software
Brainstorm:
- Current brainstorm version provides export of raw meg data into BIDS (experimental feature) - but does not generate the anatomy json
- make_bstorm_json.py adds the fiducials into the anat T1w.json file

SPM: 
- Does not currently export to bids
- Commands to extract coregistration from spm .mat file and generate bids

Fieldtrip:
- Exports to BIDS

MNE: 
- Straightforward export to BIDS
